    <div class="main-title">STORY</div>

    <p>
      The epic story of Baahubali follows the journey of Mahendra Baahubali (Sivudu), a tribal warrior who discovers his past as the son of the benevolent King Amarendra Baahubali, the rightful heir to the tyrannical kingdom of Mahishmati, ruled by his ruthless cousin Bhallaladeva. After his father's death, Mahendra must fulfill his destiny to overthrow Bhallaladeva, rescue his mother Devasena, and claim his throne, a quest that involves confronting his loyal but manipulated warrior, Kattappa, who famously killed his father under false pretenses.
      <br><br>

      <b>Part 1: Baahubali: The Beginning</b><br>
      <b>The Orphan's Quest:</b> A powerful orphan, Sivudu (Mahendra Baahubali), grows up in a secluded valley, driven by dreams to climb a giant waterfall and find its source.
      <br><br>

      <b>Discovery of the Mask & Kingdom:</b> He discovers a mask belonging to Avantika, a warrior from a rebel group trying to rescue the captive Queen Devasena from Mahishmati.
      <br><br>

      <b>Entry into Mahishmati:</b> Sivudu joins the rebels, infiltrating the tyrannical kingdom, where he encounters Kattappa and learns the dark history of his family and the injustice done to his father, Amarendra Baahubali, the true king.
      <br><br>

      <b>Confrontation & Revelation:</b> Sivudu battles Bhallaladeva, rescues Devasena, and learns from Kattappa that he is the son of Amarendra Baahubali, setting the stage for revenge.
      <br><br>

      <b>Part 2: Baahubali 2: The Conclusion</b><br>
      <b>Amarendra Baahubali's Reign:</b> Amarendra Baahubali was a just, beloved king who prioritized his people over power, in stark contrast to his envious cousin, Bhallaladeva, who craved the throne.
      <br><br>

      <b>The Conspiracy:</b> Bhallaladeva, with his father's help, conspired against Amarendra Baahubali, manipulating the queen mother, Sivagami, into believing Baahubali was unworthy.
      <br><br>

      <b>The Betrayal:</b> To secure the throne, Bhallaladeva tricked Kattappa into believing Amarendra Baahubali was a traitor, leading Kattappa to tragically kill him.
      <br><br>

      <b>The Final Battle:</b> Mahendra Baahubali (Sivudu) leads a rebellion, defeats Bhallaladeva, and with Devasena's final act of vengeance, restores justice to Mahishmati, with Mahendra and Avantika marrying and ruling.
